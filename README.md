#node-for-beginners

An intro to Node.js Programming for absolute beginners, used on hack nights at Utah Node Ninjas meetup group. Every other wednesday at Utah Node Ninjas, we provide a free introduction to Node.js, taught by our organizers. This will serve a syllabus of sorts, also provide working examples of different concepts in Node.js. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to any of the organizers of the group, and we can assist with any issues. 

##Working Code

Included in this repo is working code for various tasks in Node.js. It will guide you through some of the basics of the language, outlined in an easy to understand fashion. This portion was inspired by [mkaz/working-with-go](https://github.com/mkaz/working-with-go), which is an excellent code immersive guide to the Go programming language.

##Contributing
