#node-for-beginners

An intro to Node.js Programming for absolute beginners, used on hack nights at Utah Node Ninjas meetup group. Every other wednesday at Utah Node Ninjas, we provide a free introduction to Node.js, taught by our organizers. This will serve a syllabus of sorts, also provide working examples of different concepts in Node.js. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to any of the organizers of the group, and we can assist with any issues. 

##Working Code

Included in this repo is working code for various tasks in Node.js. It will guide you through some of the basics of the language, outlined in an easy to understand fashion. This portion was inspired by [mkaz/working-with-go](https://github.com/mkaz/working-with-go), which is an excellent code immersive guide to the Go programming language.

##Contributing

If you wish to contribute to this guide, please fork the repo and create a pull request detailing the changes made. One of our organizers will review and merge as needed.

#Intro to Node

##What is Javascript?

JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to **interact with the user**, **control the browser**, **communicate asynchronously**, and **alter the document content** that is displayed.

*It is assumed that you, as a beginner in this guide, have a basic understanding of Javascript as a programming language. If you are unfamiliar with Javascript at all, please first go through the tutorials at [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript) before continuing with this guide.*

##What is Node.js?

Node.js is a cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications. Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, and can be run within the Node.js runtime on OS X, Microsoft Windows and Linux with no changes. In short, it is **Javascript run on the server, rather than the browser**.

Node.js internally uses the Google V8 JavaScript engine to execute code, and a large percentage of the basic modules are written in JavaScript. Node.js contains a built-in asynchronous I/O library for file, socket, and HTTP communication, which allows applications to act as a Web server without software such as Apache HTTP Server or IIS.

Node.js is gaining adoption as a high-performance server-side platform and is notably used by Groupon, SAP, LinkedIn, Microsoft, Yahoo!, Walmart, Rakuten and PayPal.
